Built at Schichau in Danzig under Kaiser Wilhelm II's program of naval expansion, the battleship was laid down in 1898, launched on 21 April 1900, and commissioned the next year at a cost of 20,301,000 Marks. Armed with a main battery of four 24-centimeter (9.4 in) guns in two twin gun turrets, the ship had an active career in the Imperial Navy, apart from two lengthy stays in dry dock, until being decommissioned in 1909. Following the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, she and her sister ships were mobilized as coastal defense ships and assigned to the North and Baltic seas, but saw no combat during the war. They were withdrawn from active duty the next year and relegated to secondary duties. Kaiser Barbarossa was decommissioned after the war and broken up in 1919 and 1920. (Full article...)

The plot follows a teenager named Kei Kurono and his friend Masaru Kato, who die in a train accident and become part of a semi-posthumous game in which they, and several other recently deceased people, are forced to hunt down and kill aliens. Gantz is divided into three main story arcs, referred to as "phases". After the completion of Phase 1, the author put the series on hiatus for a short time to work on Phase 2, which is also known as "Catastrophe". Phase 1 consists of the first 237 chapters. On November 22, 2006, the first chapter of Phase 2, chapter 238, was released. As of chapter 303, the series was put in hiatus once again in order to let Oku prepare in the making of the final arc of the series. The series continued serialization in October 2009. (Full list...)
